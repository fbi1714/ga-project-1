## Explanations

  1. Technologies used in this project:
      1. Ruby on Rails as web framework
      2. Postgress as SQL database for the local development enviroment
      3. Heroku was service provide to run the application online/in-the-cloud.
      4. [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com/) as CSS library
      5. jQuery to render some effects from the Materializecss and the [Fixer.io](http://fixer.io) api.
      6. [Fixer.io](http://fixer.io) api to get the currency data
      7. [Wolfram Alpha data api](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/) to get the cities world time
      8. The Ruby on Rails [will_paginate gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/will_paginate) to generates the order tables pagination.


  2. Issues:    

    - Enable the order table to be filtered, sorted and searched.
    - Improve the currency exchange area and the time area designs.
    - Heroku issue with the Robot font. It doesn't find the font due an issue with the Ruby on Rails environments see [here](http://blog.silvabox.com/materialize-on-rails-4-with-bower-and-heroku/) a long topic about this type of problem
    - Only enable the apis data to be rendered after the user have logged in
